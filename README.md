# matrix-questionnaire

Student project to do POC for a matrix questionnaire system

Starting August 2017 we will be developing a questionnaire to support matrix evaluation, where areas of questions can be described in rows by columns supporting a scoring system for areas and difficulty.

Such a questionnaire can support our [CoDe Maturity model](http://code-maturity.praqma.com/).

Implemented in https://github.com/Praqma/questionnaire-engine - see that repository instead.
